# About Me
My name is Hannah, I am a freshman at Wake Tech. I am currently majoring in Software Development, but I am looking into the CyberSecurity program, as that interests me as well. I am pretty good with computers, but I know I still have much to learn. 

## My Interests
One of my favorite things to do is to learn new things. When school initially shut down in 2020, I taught myself **_both_** trumpet and ukulele, simply because they were there, and I was bored. Over time, I have accrued many skills. Some of these skills are practical, such as changing the oil in my car, while some of my skills are not as practical, such as identifying minutiae in fingerprints.  

Additionally, I enjoy writing, particularly poetry or short fiction. I enjoy writing poetry because I enjoy painting a picture with my words and making the reader think. Below is an example of one of my recent works.
> _The wind whispers as the water warbles  
> It's constant changing tune.  
> Listen closely if you dare
> You'll hear from deep below:  
> Your place in this chaotic world
> Is one you'll never know._

## My Favorite Websites
* *[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)*  
  I use Spotify a lot during my day-to-day activities. I often listen to the mixes that Spotify creates instead of the playlists that I have created because I enjoy discovering new artists. Additionally, I like to listen to podcasts form time to time, especially if I am driving for long periods of time.
  
* *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*  
  In addition to Spotify, I use YouTube a lot as well. Typically, I put a YouTube video on in the background while I work, particularly if what I am working on does not take much brainpower, such as doing the dishes or cleaning.
  
* *[Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/)*  
  I enjoy volunteering, and Volunteer Match is a website that allows me to view volunteer opportunities in my community. In 2022 I accrued 137 volunteer hours through my school. In 2023, I had volunteered for 117 hours, also through my school. I find great satisfaction in serving my community, and this website makes it easier for me to do so.
