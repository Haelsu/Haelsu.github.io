    <h1>My name is Hannah</h1>
    
    <p>I am a freshman at Wake Technical Community College, majoring in CyberSecurity. 
      I chose this course of study as my major because I like to be challenged, and I enjoy solving problems.
      In my free time, I enjoy weaving baskets, carving plaster, and playing video games. 
      At the moment, my favorite video games are Stardew Valley and Until Dawn. </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy finding new music to listen to, and I often utilize the 'mix' feature on Spotify so I can continue finding new songs and artists. 
      My favorite genres are oldies (1940's - 1950's oldies) and folk acoustic. 
      Every so often I revisit my guitar phase and try to play my favorite songs until my lack of calluses on my fingers make playing too painful.
